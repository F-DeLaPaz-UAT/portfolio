          <strong>Individual creator:</strong> the first session builds the baseline profile
          and a concept description; plotting happens later in the pipeline. Subsequent sessions
          are shorter and require fewer prompts because style and priorities are already known.

          <strong>Education:</strong> each studentâ€™s profile follows the work across a term,
          so concept sketches improve over time. Instructors get consistent concept pages that
          speed feedback.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Patent figure prep:</strong> capture the concept, generate blueprint-style
          line drawings, export plot-ready vectors (SVG + EBB/GRBL), and produce an editable
          vector/PDF set for a patent professional to finalize.
        </li>
